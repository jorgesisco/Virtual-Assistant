# Install the following dependencies in order to use this script:

 - pip install pyttsx3
 - pip install speech_recognition
 - pip install pip install pyaudio


# Virtual Assistant

This is just a small python script I made using 3 dependencies that allows the script to print in the console the commands I say, and it will use a voice to repear that command.

Now in the future I will figure it out how to design a ML models that will allow me to teach it how to improve the audio and be able to do something I will tell it to do.
